<b>How they qualified</b>
<br/>Bosnia-Herzegovina had an outstanding campaign, winning eight of their ten matches, drawing and losing just once. A ruthless attack and resilient rearguard were the cornerstones of the side’s success, with the 30 goals scored representing the fourth-highest tally in European zone qualifying. Equally impressive was a defence that was breached just six times. Bosnia-Herzegovina’s notable goal difference proved crucial too, edging them past a Greece side that finished level on points, to secure direct passage to Brazil 2014 and a first appearance at a FIFA World Cup™.
<br/>After starting with a string of victories combined with a goalless draw in Greece, coach Safet Susic’s team’s campaign initially went according to plan. However, a 1-0 defeat at home to Slovakia in September 2013 set up a nail-biting finale for Bosnia-Herzegovina, before they pipped Greece to the post on the final matchday.
<br/><b>The key players</b>
<br/>Bosnia-Herzegovina have a core of talented players capable of changing games in an instant, ranging from the likes of Edin Dzeko and Vedad Ibisevic up front, through midfielders Miralem Pjanic and Zvjezdan Misimovic, all the way back to defensive rock Emir Spahic and goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. The majority of the squad regularly showcase their talents in Europe’s biggest leagues, giving them the experience necessary to shine on the biggest stage of them all.
